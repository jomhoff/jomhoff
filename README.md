Hey all, Iâ€™m @jomhoff!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Richard Gilder Graduate School at the American Museum of Natural History. My research focuses on using genomics to study speciation, introgression, and hybridization. 
Currently, I am investigating the dynamics of these processes on a macroevolutionary scale with _Plestiodon_ skinks.
