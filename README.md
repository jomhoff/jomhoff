Howdy folks, Iâ€™m @jomhoff!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Richard Gilder Graduate School at the Americna Museum of Natural History. My research is focused on the interplay of speciation genomics and biogeography. 
Currently, I am investigating the dynamics of these processes on a macroevolutionary scale with _Plestiodon_ skinks.

Beyond speciation and biogeography, I am interested in conservation genomics as well as ecology. 

I have a cat named Princess Raskolnikov, she looks like this:
